# blazar_analysis

This repository presents some of the code used in my data analysis of blazars. We obtained the lightcurves of over 3000 blazars in two energy bands: optical and gamma-ray. We analysis this large population of objects to understand the overall behavior of this population and sub-populations of blazars.
